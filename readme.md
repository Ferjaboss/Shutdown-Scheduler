## I Wrote this using VIM

This project wasn't initially planned; it was born out of necessity.

I often update my Steam games overnight, and during one update, I had a small patch that would take about an hour to finish. That’s when I thought, "Why not create a program that automates this process so I can use it whenever I need to?"

So, here I am, combining my love for coding with the need for a useful tool. The result? A shutdown scheduler app that automates the process for me.

P.S. If you're using Vim, don't forget to use :wq! to quit with a smile ❤️
